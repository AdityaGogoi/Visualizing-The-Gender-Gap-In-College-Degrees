# Visualizing-The-Gender-Gap-In-College-Degrees
Storytelling Through Data Visualization

In this project, we'll extend the work we did in the last project (Visualizing Earnings based on College Majors) on visualizing the gender gap across college degrees. So far, we mostly focused on the STEM degrees but now we will generate line charts to compare across all degree categories. In the last step of this guided project, we'll explore how to export the final diagram we create as an image file.
